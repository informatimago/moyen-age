Moyen-Age
---------

This is a little text-based role game,
implemented with local LLM AI (ollama).

To launch the game:

    cd moyen-age
    ./game

It uses the ollama-game script at each
step to communicate with the LLM.

It saves the current state in ~/.moyen-age.state

BUGS:

- the state is not cummulative. It only keps the "current" status,
  forgetting older state. So if we come back to a previous place, it
  will have forgotten what was determined in that place previously.
